# Next.js Template with Docker

A modern Next.js template with Docker support, Sass/SCSS styling, and a convenient development workflow.

## Features

- üê≥ Docker and Docker Compose support
- üé® Sass/SCSS for styling
- üì± Responsive design
- üîÑ Hot reloading in development
- üì¶ TypeScript support
- üõ†Ô∏è Convenient development commands
- üöÄ Production-ready Docker configuration

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nextjs-template
```

2. Start the development server:

### Using Docker Compose (Works on both Windows and Unix)
```bash
docker-compose up dev
```

### Using Make Commands

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Start development server (with hot reload)
.\make.cmd dev

# Build and start development server
.\make.cmd up

# Start development server (without logs)
.\make.cmd start

# Stop development server
.\make.cmd stop

# Shell into development container
.\make.cmd bash
```

#### Unix-based Systems (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Start development server (with hot reload)
make dev

# Build and start development server
make up

# Start development server (without logs)
make start

# Stop development server
make stop

# Shell into development container
make bash
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

## Available Commands

### Development

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Start development server (with hot reload)
docker-compose up dev
# OR
.\make.cmd dev

# Build and start development server
.\make.cmd up

```

### Production

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Start production server
docker-compose up prod
# OR

.\make.cmd build
```

#### Unix-based Systems (Linux/macOS)

```

### Maintenance

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell

make clean
```

## Development

The project uses:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Sass/SCSS for styling
- Docker for containerization
- TypeScript for type safety

## Port Configuration
